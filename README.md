# pokemon-ai
A pokemon battle simulator with an ai that makes it challenging to beat

This project was inspired by the original gameboy / DS Pokemon games. It is pretty easy to play and beat the AI in the main series games. On the other hand, when playing other human beings, it’s more difficult and requires more strategy. This program simulates a battle within the game that will use strategy in order to beat the human player. So, playing against the computer will be as difficult as playing another player.

The program essentially does this by assigning a score to every option that the computer has each turn, given the current state of the game.

## Requirements
This project runs on Python 3 and requires Tkinter and Pillow.

## Run code
Go into the directory and run `__init__.py`
```
